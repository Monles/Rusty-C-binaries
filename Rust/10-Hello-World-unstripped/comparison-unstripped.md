### Kali Compilation (Stripped)
# Rust (Stripped)
#### This is the import rummary result of Ghidra.
We can see mangledstrings at the beginning.

### Rntry Point
![](./screenshots/RE/C-stripped/42.png)
![](./screenshots/RE/C-stripped/43.png)

No direct link to `main`function due to stripping.
![](./screenshots/RE/C-stripped/44.png)
![](./screenshots/RE/C-stripped/45.png)
From `Symbol Tree`, we cannot find `_start` (original entry point before `libc_start_main`) or `main`.

More `ELF` source files while importing the binary to Ghidra.

More required libraries.

Many unsupported thread symbols due to the mangling scheme/strings.

## Ghidra V.2024
- ‚≠ê So, actually Ghidra can detect whether the binary is Rust or not.
- But fail to demangle the rust managled strings

## Analyzers
They all have functions below:
- Demangler Rust
- Rust String Analyzer
![](./screenshots/RE/Rust-unstripped/59.png)

Entry point can find `main` in Rust if this binary is unstripped.
![](./screenshots/RE/Rust-unstripped/60.png)
However, the strings are manageld still.
![](./screenshots/RE/Rust-unstripped/61.png)

Need to manually demange the strings if possible.

Tried Legact feature, it seems not working.

![](./screenshots/Unstripped/C/24.png)
### Dynamic Linking
- That's because I compiled the c program with `gcc` on Kali Linux without static linking.
- The binary doesn't contain the full implementation of the library functions it used (like `printf`).
- Instead, it relies on shared libraries (e.g., `libc.so.6`) that are linked at runtime by the dynamic linker (`ld-linux.so`).
