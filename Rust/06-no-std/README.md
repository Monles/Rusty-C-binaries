In Rust, there is no built-in attribute called `non-standard` related to the `rt` (runtime) module. However, there are some attributes that deal with features often considered "non-standard" or unstable, especially when writing code that interacts with the Rust runtime or does low-level programming. These include attributes like `#[no_std]` and `#[no_main]`, which are more commonly used in `no_std` environments or embedded programming.

Here's a brief explanation of some related attributes:

1. **`#[no_std]`**:
   - This attribute disables the standard library and is often used in embedded development or bare-metal programming.
   - It tells the Rust compiler to use the `core` library instead of the `std` library. The `core` library provides essential functionality that does not depend on the underlying operating system.

   ```rust
   #![no_std]
   ```

2. **`#[no_main]`**:
   - This attribute is used to indicate that the program should not use the standard Rust runtime to define the `main` function.
   - Instead, you provide your own entry point, which is useful for writing custom runtime behavior, often in environments without an operating system.

   ```rust
   #![no_main]
   ```

3. **`#[non_exhaustive]`**:
   - While not directly related to `rt` or runtime modules, this attribute is used to indicate that a struct or enum may have more fields or variants added in the future, preventing exhaustive pattern matching.

4. **Feature Attributes**:
   - Rust has a way to enable non-standard or experimental features using feature flags. These are usually relevant when working with nightly Rust.
   - For example, `#![feature(custom_attribute)]` enables certain unstable features.

### Using Attributes with `rt` Modules
If you are working on a low-level project that involves the Rust runtime, you might come across the following pattern in embedded or operating system programming:

- **`#[entry]`** (used in embedded development with the `cortex-m-rt` crate):
  - In embedded development, the `cortex-m-rt` crate provides the `#[entry]` attribute to define the entry point of the application.
  
- **`#[rtfm::app]`** (used with Real-Time For the Masses framework):
  - In real-time and embedded systems, the `RTFM` (Real-Time For the Masses) framework uses `#[rtfm::app]` to set up tasks and interrupts.

If you are referring to a custom or application-specific attribute called `non-standard`, it might be a convention used in your codebase or framework. If you can provide more context, Iâ€™d be happy to explain or clarify further!
